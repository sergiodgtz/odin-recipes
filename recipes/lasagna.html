        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. 
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
                Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
                In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.        
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
