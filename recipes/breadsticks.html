        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (13.8 oz) refrigerated pizza crust (such as PillsburyÂ®)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a
                baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Roll out pizza dough into an approximate 8 x 12 inch rectangle and place on prepared baking sheet. 
                Pre-bake pizza dough for 10 minutes. 
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Mix butter, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder in a small bowl until well
                combined. Brush pizza dough with butter mixture and top with Mozzarella cheese. 
                Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted and edges of dough have started to brown, 6 to 10 more minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Cut into slices and serve at once.
